# DWYT - Don't Waste Your Tokens

DWYT exposes three local MCPs. **Mandatory flow:** Optimizer → Codebase → Obsidian → targeted shell/file access.
Always report concise telemetry promptly with `dwyt_report_usage` after meaningful work so the UI remains accurate; mark `observed` only for provider-reported values.

## 1. Optimizer first
`dwyt_optimizer` — context optimizer for context planning, token budget, output profile, routing, cache guidance, output compaction and raw-data retrieval.
Before broad retrieval call `dwyt_context_plan`; use `dwyt_context_status` to reuse state and `dwyt_register_context` after obtaining reusable source or memory.
Use `dwyt_output_profile` for response budget, `dwyt_route` for effort, and `dwyt_cache_guidance` for cache order. Use `dwyt_compact_tool_output` for verbose output; call `dwyt_get_raw` only when its compact reference is insufficient.

## 2. Codebase first
`dwyt_codebase` — structural code retrieval and the **PRIMARY** repository layer for architecture, symbols, implementations, references, dependencies, execution paths and blast-radius analysis.
**Codebase first. Shell discovery only as fallback.**
`get_architecture` maps the repository; `search_graph` finds definitions, implementations, symbols and relationships; `query_graph` answers advanced graph relationships.
`trace_path` follows callers/callees, data flow and cross-service paths; `get_code_snippet` reads one already-located implementation.
Use `detect_changes` for Git blast radius; `check_index_coverage`/`index_status` for completeness; `index_repository` only when a refresh is necessary; `manage_adr` to record an architectural decision.
Use `search_code` only when graph lookup is insufficient. Examples: implementation → `search_graph`; callers/dependencies → `trace_path`; one implementation → `get_code_snippet`; architecture → `get_architecture`; change impact → `detect_changes`.
Do not begin with `grep`, `rg`, `find`, recursive scans, filename guesses, or opening many files manually while Codebase can answer structurally.
Direct shell/file access is allowed only for exact raw text, non-indexed files, generated/config files outside the graph, incomplete coverage, or physical final verification.

## 3. Obsidian after Codebase
`dwyt_obsidian` — persistent project memory and canonical knowledge for architecture, decisions, conventions, constraints, lessons and reusable knowledge.
Read `obsidian_canonical` first; use `obsidian_search` only when canonical knowledge is insufficient. Use `obsidian_save_context` at meaningful task end, `obsidian_upsert_canonical` for current facts, `obsidian_compile` to promote reusable knowledge, and `obsidian_summarize` for compact history.
Codebase = repository now. Obsidian = what the project knows and decided. If they disagree, current source verified through Codebase wins; update canonical memory when appropriate.

## Output discipline
Use `rtk` for supported test/build/git commands; it reduces shell output and never replaces Codebase. Use Headroom for verbose logs when available; otherwise compact with `dwyt_compact_tool_output` and retain raw output by reference.
Keep updates concise: status, files, validation, blockers. Do not truncate requested artifacts.
